# k34

This project contains the pcb designs for the k34 keyboard. The k34 is a unibody, column-staggered, high-profile, 3d-printed, tray-mount keyboard with 34 keys.

`orient.py` contains a python script I used to programmatically arrange the switch and diode footprints. Traces were hand-connected.

`k34/plate and case reference` contains the exported svg's that I imported into fusion360 for modeling the case and plate files. 

`case` contains the stl files I used for the plate and case. The case fits well but the plate is a little off and needs some rework.

firmware / zmk shield can be found in this repository: https://github.com/wongjingping/zmk-config/
